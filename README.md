## Description

Super Metronome Hero is a rhythm game. Rather than trying to make a game I
wanted to play out of this rather popular genre I decided to send it up with
this nonsense joke game. The game has only one button (which is ANY button on
your keyboard, incidentally) which you must press in time at the specified
tempo, every beat for four bars. You unlock different tempos as you progress.

Rhythm games are the only genre I truly hate, but since I lack any music-making
skills or equipment, I would have had to find decent-quality public domain music
to make a true guitar-hero style game. To save myself this trouble, I decided
instead to boil the concept down to its bare bones. Enjoy!

Major thank you to my friend Dan (@djcsdy) for encouragement and some technical
assistance.

I used Flashpunk to write the game. The source is available online here...
